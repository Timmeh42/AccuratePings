# AccuratePings

Risk of Rain 2 mod to make pings more accurate

 - When a player pings something, the game searches in a cone for the closest (?) object. This gets annoying when trying to ping things in the distanct with a closer object nearby.
 - This mod makes the angle of the cone configurable, so you get a narrower / more accurate ping.


Configuration is done in the `/BepInEx/config/com.Timmeh42.AccuratePings.cfg` file, which appears after loading the game once.

### Installation

- Requires BepInEx
- Copy the dll to the BepinEx plugins folder
